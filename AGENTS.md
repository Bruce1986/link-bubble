# Guidelines for Codex

- Before committing changes to JavaScript files, run `npm run lint`.
- If `npm test` exists, run it as well.
- Use two-space indentation and semistandard style for JS.
- Summaries should briefly mention lint and test results.
- Gradle builds require JDK 8. Ensure `JAVA_HOME` points to JDK 8 or use the
  `.java-version` file when building the Android project.
